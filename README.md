This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Resources to get started (in zip file attached): 
- A JSON file to be used as the data source to populate the web page 
- A wire mockup of what your final web page should look like 
- SVG of Stackline logo 

### We are looking for: 
- A solution that resembles the provided mock up closely and implements AT LEAST ONE of either the graph and/or table as seen in the mock up 
- A working solution that takes the provided JSON file as output from a stubbed-out API call 
- A solution that implements React and Redux best practices and patterns. TS is encouraged. 
- Clean code 

### Assets to be returned via email within the provided time frame: 
- A public repository to view the final code (deploy it to github pages or AWS and share that link with us) 
- A public URL to view the web page (a link to the public github repository) 

### To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech Used
- Next.js
- React
- Typescript
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js (react-chartjs-2)
